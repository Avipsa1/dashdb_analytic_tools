#   IN-DATABASE LINEAR REGRESSION FUNCTION   #
##############################################

# This sample evaluates a large amount of data that relates the number of users of a system to the
# amount of memory used and creates a plot of the line that best fits these data points. Such a
# plot can be used to predict memory usage when the number of users is known. The relatively low
# standard-error value returned by the linear regression function indicates that the relationship
# between memory usage and number of users is indeed strongly linear.  

# Before processing data, most native R functions require that the data first be extracted from a
# database to working memory. Such a function is called an in-application function. A different type
# of function, called an in-database function, operates directly on data in a database, without the
# data first having to be extracted. Consequently, you can use an in-database function to analyze
# large amounts of data that would be impractical or impossible to extract. 

# An in-database function can exploit performance-enhancing features of the underlying database
# management system, such as BLU columnar technology. It also avoids security issues associated with
# extracting data, and ensures that the data being analyzed is as current as possible.

# This sample employs the in-database linear regression function (idaLm), which performs better than
# the corresponding in-application function (lm) for large data sets. To explore the differences
# between in-database and in-application functions, run both this sample and the sample that uses
# the corresponding in-application function, and compare the elapsed times.

# Subsequent comments in this sample script describe the steps carried out by its R statements.
